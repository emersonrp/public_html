<h2>syntax.tcl plugin</h2>

This is a placeholder html file for my syntax.tcl plugin for <a href="http://www.awns.com/">tkMOO-light</a>, the excellent cross-platform MOO/MUD/MUSH chat client.  There used to be a long explanation of what this does and why you'd want it and how I got here and where I might go from here and all sorts of other musings, but it disappeared in a horrible disk crash.<p>

So, without further attempts to reconstruct all of that, here's the short version and the link to the latest copy:<p>

syntax.tcl is a plugin for tkMOO-light that adds MOO-code syntax highlighting to the local editor window.  It's extensible, itself, via further plugins for other syntax modules, and has a lightweight MOO-mail syntax flavor as an example.  It works fine, but could do with lots of fixes and additions.  Feedback always welcome.<p>
